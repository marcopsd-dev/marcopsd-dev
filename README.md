## 💡 What Makes My Work Different

Most security professionals focus either on infrastructure OR operations. I bridge both worlds:

✅ **Design secure cloud architectures** using CloudFormation and infrastructure as code  
✅ **Build automation that solves real security problems** with Python and AI integration  
✅ **Understand frontline security operations** through hands-on SIEM, SOC, and vulnerability management

This combination allows me to create tools that are both technically sophisticated and operationally practical—infrastructure that's secure by design and automation that security teams actually want to use.
